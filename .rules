# Project Environment Instructions

1. ENVIRONMENT: We are using `micromamba` with the environment `ultraplot-dev`.
   - ALWAYS assume `micromamba run -n ultraplot-dev` for any shell commands.
   - Do NOT suggest pip or conda unless explicitly asked.

2. LIBRARIES:
   - Use `ultraplot` for plotting (not standard matplotlib).
