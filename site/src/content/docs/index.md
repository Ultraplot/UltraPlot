# UltraPlot Docs (Prototype)

This docs site is generated by Astro and uses markdown content pages in `site/src/content/docs`.

## Current State

- Narrative docs remain in `docs/*.rst` (Sphinx).
- API pages are generated into this site using:
  `tools/docs/generate_astro_api.py`.
- This enables gradual migration without splitting docs from package source.

## Next Steps

1. Port high-traffic narrative pages (`install`, `basics`, `subplots`) to markdown.
2. Add notebook/example execution artifacts to Astro build output.
3. Preserve route compatibility with redirect maps from Sphinx URLs.
